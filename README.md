	Since my capstone project is based on surveying the land at the Huntington Gardens and creating a 3D point cloud, the supervisors of the proposal wondered if we could possibly classify the trees as well. After doing some research to see if this was possible, especially in the short timeframe, it appears that deep learning exists for classification of different plants and trees as well as phenology monitoring. The accuracy, however, varies as “image-based methods often still require substantial manual efforts in order to extract ecologically relevant data,” (Mann, H.M.R., et al.). Tracking phenology is extremely important to detect the effects of climate change, crop yield, as well as 
	In the first study, the researchers used time-lapse imagery from different seasons and different times of the day to capture all features and phases of the flowers. For phenology monitoring, they used “training and validation data” to train the model to know what to look for in features, (Mann, H.M.R., et al.). They were able to find success in deep learning with only 8.2% of the detected flowers being false positives. While it is important to determine the phenology of flowers to understand the effects of climate change, computer vision deems to be useful in agriculture as well.
	In the second study, researchers use Street Level Imagery (SLI), which is ground perspective imagery, to create deep learning for crop identification and phenology, (d’Andrimont, Raphaël, et al.). They claim this methodology is cost efficient. The researchers collected eight data samples at the Dutch Province of Flevoland to ensure all types and stages of the crops were captured. Just like the first study, this study uses training data to help the model determine the best parameters. This study specifically uses “hypertuning,” which is “the process of systematically trying various parameter settings in order to find the best fit for the relevant classification task,” (d’Andrimont, Raphaël, et al.). Through this, they gathered about 88% accuracy with crop type and 86% accuracy with phenological stage.
	What we found out in our project is that LiDAR data is extremely expensive and actually hard to come by.  This last study is very similar to our capstone project, except we actually got access to free high resolution LiDAR data. Instead of utilizing LiDAR data, researchers in this study use RGB “Ecosynth” methodology, which “combines advances and techniques from many areas of research, including computer vision structure from motion, UAS, and LIDAR point cloud data processing,” (Dandois, Jonathan P., and Erle C. Ellis). For the most part, the Ecosynth methodology compared similarly to the use of LiDAR, except some results were weaker, like field-measured tree height in one study area.
